    <h2>Javascript history</h2>
    <p>
      JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that
      conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[10] It has dynamic typing,
      prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
      multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative
      programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for
      working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures,
      and the Document Object Model (DOM).
