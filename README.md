Repository Description**

This repository contains a collection of projects and programs I developed during my training phase. It includes work written in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Angular, Node.js, and Express.js. These programs reflect my learning journey and cover a variety of concepts, including:

- Frontend development with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Building single-page applications using Angular.
- Developing backend services with Node.js and Express.js.

The folders in this repository house complex programs and projects that I created independently as part of my training. These files serve as a reference for my work and demonstrate my approach to solving real-world problems during this phase.

Feel free to explore the code and projects. If you have any questions or feedback, youâ€™re welcome to reach out!
