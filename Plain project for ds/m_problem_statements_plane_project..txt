SIMULATE AIRPORT LANDING AND TAKEOFF PATTERN.

PROBLEM STATEMENT : 
		1. The Airport has three runways and has four landing holding patterns. Two landing holding patterns for each of the first two runways.
		2. Arriving plane will enter into one of the holding patterns queues and assigned an integer ID with number of time units the plane can remain in the queue before it 
must land(Because of the low fuel level).
		3. The airport has queue for takeoffs for each of the three runways and arriving planes into the takeoff queue are also assigned with ID.
		4. At each time three planes may arrive at the landing queues and also takeoff queues. Each arriving planes has time unit of fuel remaining.
		5. Each runway can handle one takeoff or one landing at a time. but third runway  handles only  takeoffs, except when a plane is low on fuel (At each time unit ,
planes in landing queues whose air time has reached zero) then given priority over other landings and takeoffs. If only one plane is in this category then runway 3 is used. If more 
than one plane is in this category then other runways will be used (At each time slot at most 3 planes can be serviced in this way).
		6. Use successive even integer ID's for takeoff planes and odd integer ID's for landing planes.
		7. Arriving planes must be placed at end of the queues. The queues should be kept the same size.

 From the given statements, we need to design a algorithm to Simulate an airport landing and takeoff pattern.


WHAT WE HAVE TO PRODUCE ? 
	At each time unit
		1. The contents of each queues.
		2. The average takeoff waiting time and avearge landing waiting time.
		3. The average flying time remaining on landing and the number of plains landing with no fuel reserve.
