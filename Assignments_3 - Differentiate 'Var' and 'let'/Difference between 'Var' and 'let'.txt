DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 'VAR AND 'LET'

What is 'var' keyword ? 
	1.  'var' keyword is old way of declaring variable.
	2.  'var' keyword is a function scope so we can access var declared variable anywhere in the function block.
	3.  If you are using 'var' variable before initialization it will not give error. it will give 'undefined'.
	(EX) - console.log(a);
		var a = 10;
		o/p ----> Undefined
	4. Before  ES6 we have only Global scope and Function Scope so we have used 'var' keyword . it doesn't care about block scopes inside of the function.

When we use 'var' keyword ?
	1. if you want to run your code in older version browsers you must use 'var' keyword.
	2. You can create a variable with 'var' inside the block scope then you can able to get a variable from outside of the block and inside of the function anywhere.
	3. You need to access a variable inside of the function and don't care about block then we can use 'var' keyword.

What is 'let' keyword ?
	1.'Let' keyword introduced in ES6 ( modern js ).
	2. 'let' is block scoped varible.
	3. If you are using 'let' variable before initialization it will give error which is the variable is not declared.
	(EX) - console.log(a);
		let a = 10;
		o/p ----> a is not declared.

When to you 'let' keyword ?
	1. If you can reassign the value of the variable then use 'let'.
	2. When we are working with looping conditions its helpfull.
	3. Your declared variable inside the block dont want to access in outside of the block scope then use 'let'. 

what is 'a=0'(no keywords) ? 
	1. A variable doesn't have a keyword is called global Scoped Variable.
	(EX)  a=0;

When we can use 'a=0' (no keyword) ?
	1. If we want to give access permission to the entire code , dont care about blocks  then we will use a variable without keyword.
