DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CLASS AND OBJECT : 
-----------------------------------------------------------
	1. Class is the skeleton of the body (its like blueprint).
	2. Class has the properties and methods (like handbone,skull,walk,speak,read,etc).
	3. Its unique.
	4. Class is a common entity.(EX - Dog,Human,Bike,Road and etc)
	5. When we declare a class , that is lifeless  human body.
	6. After creating Objects for the class , then will be the class (human body) has life.
	7. Object is the instances or references or user of the class.
	8. Objects seems like real world entity ( paper, pen etc)
	9. Objects are not same. Each object should be unique. Never exist before.(If we have a object called Iphone,Then we can create Iphone ,Then its not valid)
	10. Objects will define the properties and methods of the class.
	11. With the one class we call create multiple objects.
	12. Objects and classes have the close relationship. here God is the class and the Murugan is the object.

Example of class and objects :
----------------------------------------
	1.Class name is Airport
	2.Objects => KempaGowdaAirport
	3.Objects => ChennaiAirport
	4.Objects => TrichyAirport.

Here i will explain about Abstraction.
	If i am going to KempagowdaAirport to drop my friend by my car and I want to take selfies at selfie spot and I need to use of restroom urgently.
 Then I will  search parking property, Selfiespot property and restroom property after i need to make use of it. And then I don't care about ticket counter,boarding point properties etc.
This is example for Abstraction.

ABSTRACTION : 
---------------------
         If I want to use particular properties to reach my goal then i will focus on that. And I ignore all other properties that i dont want. Here another example is If i am a driver
I just focus brake,clutch and accelerator. I dont know the engine functionilty and internal funtionalities.
